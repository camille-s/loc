Born Free and Equal


This special presentation reproduces the book *[Born Free and Equal](http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.gdc/scd0001.20020123001bf.2)*, a selection of Ansel Adams's photographs of the Manzanar internment camp which was published in 1944 by U.S. Camera along with a text by Adams. The digital images were made from the 112-page copy held by the Prints and Photographs Division. In a letter to his friend Nancy Newhall, the wife of Beaumont Newhall, curator of photography at the Museum of Modern Art, Adams wrote: "Through the pictures the reader will be introduced to perhaps twenty individuals . . . loyal American citizens who are anxious to get back into the stream of life and contribute to our victory." The book received positive reviews and made the *San Francisco Chronicle's* bestseller list for March and April of 1945. A hardcover edition of Born Free and Equal (Bishop, CA: Spotted Dog Press, 2001) is available which corrects surname and chronological errors found in the original and includes essays by former internees Archie Miyatake and Sue Kunitomi Embrey.
